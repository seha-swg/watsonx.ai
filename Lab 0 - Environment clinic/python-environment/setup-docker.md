# Installing Docker on Windows

Docker is a platform that allows you to develop, ship, and run applications inside containers. Follow these steps to install Docker on your Windows system.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have administrative privileges on your Windows system.
- Make sure that your system meets the [minimum requirements for Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/).

## Steps

### 1. Download Docker Desktop Installer
- Visit the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and download the Docker Desktop installer for Windows.

### 2. Run Docker Desktop Installer
- Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded installer file (usually named something like `Docker Desktop Installer.exe`) and double-click to run it.

### 3. Install Docker Desktop
- Follow the on-screen instructions in the installer wizard to complete the installation process. Accept the license agreement and choose the installation directory if prompted. Click "Install" to proceed.

### 4. Enable Hyper-V (If Required)
- Docker Desktop requires Hyper-V to run on Windows. If Hyper-V is not already enabled, the installer will prompt you to enable it. Follow the instructions to enable Hyper-V and restart your system if necessary.

### 5. Start Docker Desktop
- Once the installation is complete, Docker Desktop should start automatically. If not, you can start it from the Start menu.

### 6. Verify Docker Installation
- After Docker Desktop starts, you should see the Docker icon in the system tray. Click on the Docker icon and select "About Docker" to verify that Docker is installed correctly and running.

### 7. Test Docker Installation
- Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run the following command to verify that Docker is installed and working:
```
docker --version
```

- You should see the Docker version number if Docker is installed correctly.

### 8. Conclusion
- Congratulations! You have successfully installed Docker Desktop on your Windows system. You can now start using Docker to develop and deploy containerized applications.

This guide should help you get started with Docker on your Windows machine. Happy containerizing!
